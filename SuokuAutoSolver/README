A sudoku Auto solver using the backtracking algorithm

'bo' defines the board to be solved.

This simple auto solver first finds the 0's on the board. Then runs the 'valid' function to check if the answer is valid.
If it is valid, then it moves on to the next 0. If no valid answer is found it backtracks to the previous solved 0, and changes it,
then attempts to solve the previously unsolved 0 again.
