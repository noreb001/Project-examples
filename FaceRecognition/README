A program writen in MATLAB for Facial recognition. 

The 'fisherface' file conducts the main facial recognition function, using fisherface facial recognition. A breakdown of how this 
works is detailed in the file using comments going step by step through the proccess. 

Face detection is peformed by the 'getFace' file. This uses a cascade object detector that has been pre trained by MATLAB for 
accurate face detection.

The detected face region can then be inputed in to the other files to detect other features of the face such as the nose, eyes, mouth.
These can be used in the 'fisherface' file as a further measure used for facial recognition.

The 'EyeDetect' file also captures the eyebrow region, for fruther proccessing in the 'EyebrowLenght' file. Which uses Harris features
to detect the edges of the eyebrow. The lowest edge and the highest edge detected on the eyebrow are then compared to get a estimate of 
the eyebrow lenght. This is another Biometric feature that is extracted from the face picture.

All of these facial fetures are proccesed in the fisherface file and then inserted in to a weighted voting system, to compare the accuracy 
of individual features vs global face detection.
